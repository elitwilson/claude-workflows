# Quality Gates

## Purpose

Quality gates are checkpoints that must be satisfied before transitioning between phases in the development workflow.

This document is a placeholder for defining specific quality standards and checklists that apply across all projects.

---

## Current Status

Quality gates are currently defined within specific workflow documents:
- TDD phase transitions: see [tdd-workflow.md](tdd-workflow.md)
- Planning completion: see FEATURE_PLAN template

---

## Future Vision

This document may eventually contain:
- Universal code quality standards
- Security checklist items
- Performance criteria
- Documentation completeness checks
- Pre-deployment verification steps

For now, refer to the quality gate checklists embedded in individual workflow documents.
